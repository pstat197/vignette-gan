## Vignette abstract
This vignette introduces the fundamentals of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and demonstrates how to build and train a simple GAN using PyTorch. Two example datasets are used: MNIST, which contains handwritten digits, and Fashion-MNIST, which contains grayscale images of clothing items. The notebook explains the generator–discriminator setup, shows how adversarial training is implemented, and visualizes the synthetic images produced during training. The goal is to give students an accessible, hands-on starting point for understanding how GANs work and how they can be applied to image generation tasks.

## Repository contents
The primary vignette document for this project is the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/Intro_GAN.ipynb`, which combines step-by-step explanations with executable PyTorch code. The rest of the repository is organized to support reproducibility and reuse:
